Hi, [I'm Stuart](/about), and welcome. I'm a developer with an extra: a background
in the cognitive and social sciences. I love to create products and solutions that 
make people's everyday lives better. But more than that, I treat every
application I create as a performance, a demonstration of skill and craft. So 
please feel free to read on, browse, or [contact me to find out more](/contact).
