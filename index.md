"Today's technology applications are increasingly complex, with components
interacting between customer's smartphones, cloud servers, databases, and third
party components such as artificial intelligence models. It takes unique skills to see the
big picture, and to design products that can solve problems without burdening
users.

I can help you build those skills. I have decades of experience as a developer
working across artificial intelligence, embedded technology, front end
interfaces, and back office systems. I'm a practicing qualified cognitive and
social scientist, so I can show you the value of those perspectives, and help you shape a
team that creates an effective and successful product."
