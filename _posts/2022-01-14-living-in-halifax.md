Scientific customer management and how it breaks products


---

Scientific management, by the standards of the day, was wildly successful
and influential, shaping everything from McDonalds to the Soviet Union -- where
Lenin, initially skeptical of American ideas, ended up endorsing scientific 
management and its benefits for “lazy” Russian workers.

Taylor identified five main principles:

1.	Science, not rule of thumb
2.	Harmony, not discord
3.	Mental revolution
4.	Cooperation, not individualism
5.	Development of every person to their greatest efficiency and prosperity

Much as Taylor gets the credit, modern scientific management is at least as
influenced by William Sealy Gosset, also known as "Student", head brewer at
Guinness and statistician par excellence. 

Science, not rule of thumb

First and foremost, scientific management was about replacing human judgements 
by "science".

So, what's the link between Taylor's work in pre-Depression steel factories and
the modern world? I think there are two strands.

Scientific management and the modern panopticon

First, modern internet technology, and especially artificial intelligence,
has enabled scientific management to work at a far greater scale. What we're
building now is essentially a "modern panopticon". It's no longer a physical
built structure, because it doesn't need to be. Thanks to the deep integration
of analytics into everything, decision-makers can follow activity no matter
where we are, even at home, even in the middle of a pandemic.

Perhaps the greatest exponents of modern scientific management are McDonalds 
and Google and similar big technology companies. 

In Google, for example, cooperation is reinforced by explicitly developing a
social identity as a "Googler". 

It should, therefore, come as no surprise that Google is as actively anti-union
as Taylor was himself. Sometimes, nothing much changes.

Github, for example, is a perfect example of a scientific management tool.

The second strand is related, and also depends on technology to scale. However,
instead of focusing on employees, it focuses on customers. Perhaps the most 
well-documented model of this is Netflix and its use of "consumer science", 
which is very substantially exactly the same as scientific management but for
customers instead of employees.

Note that Apple, at least under Steve Jobs, didn't use anything like the 
same method. Reed Hastings, Netflix’s founder, put it this way:

> “Leaders like Steve Jobs have a sense of style and what customers seek, 
> but I don’t. We need consumer science to get there” 

So CRMs are tools for McDonaldization, especially in sales and marketing. 
By using templates and standard emails, they make communication with customers 
efficient, predictable, and controlled. They collect data on how often we open 
and read emails, and use that data to test emails — exactly like Gosset tested 
different types of barley in fields. The difference is, in the case of 
companies like McDonalds, the science is being applied to people, not plants,
and to customers, not employees.

So, I'm not entirely convinced that surveillance capitalism 

Is it possible, therefore, that the erosion in products is linked to
the use of analytics? Where once was judgement and craft, now there is 
science?

Yet another lens to look at this is: risk. As Ulrich Beck has argued,
the "second modernity" is one of a risk society. And the use of "science"
in scientific management is really all about minimizing and eliminating
risk. Particularly in a business like that of Netflix, they want to 
commission series that are likely to be successful. How to do that? 
That was *exactly* what Gosset's work was about. 

As T. S. Eliot put it "Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? 
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?" Data does not have 
the answers, the methods do. And it is to people like Gosset we should
look for the methods.
