title: Super size my brain: self-actualization and AI
---

When I hear the increasing stories of the effects of large language models --
which increasingly seem to be transforming people's mental capacities in
ways that are obviously harmful -- I wonder if there's a useful analogy with
Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me"?

In effect, is there a kind of “cognitive diet” that can be good — or bad — for
us? Can we end up consuming information in a way that slowly poisons us,
destroying our ability to function independently. 

In effect, are our mental capacities malleable or not? 

If they are malleable -- what if they are capable of being damaged by certain
processes and stimuli?[^trauma]

[^trauma]: Let's leave trauma out of this, and focus more on more everyday
experiences.



Next, addiction. THere certainly is evidence that a kind of addiction to large
language models both exists and [can be
measured](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401225000209). 

One way to think about this is through tye work of Abraham Maslow, and especially 
his "hierarch of needs", usually shown as a pyramid (although Maslow never depicted
it that way). At the bottom are the basic needs, and only once those are being met 
are we able to explore higher ones. Originally at the top was "self actualization".

Maslow interviewed a fair number of "selr-actualizers", to find out ehat they had in common,
and what marked them apart from the rest of us. All in all, he found about fourteen
common behaviours. 

1. Efficient perception of reality
2. Acceptance of Self, Others and Nature
3. Spontaneity; Simplicity; Naturalness
4. Problem Centering -- they have a missiom in life
5. they can be solitary without discomfort
6. Autonomy (Independence of Culture and Environment)
7. Continued Freshness of Appreciation
8. Mystic Experiences (Peak Experiences)
9. Gemeinschaftsgegühl 
10. deeper and more profound interpersonal relations
11. friendly with anyone of a suitable character regardless of class, education, political belief, race or color
12. Discrimination Between Good and Evil
13. Philosophical, Un-Hostile Sense of Humor
14. Creativeness, "akin to the universal creativeness of unspoiled children"
15. The Transcendence of Culture; Resistance to Enculturation

Now lets go through these and reflect on how they relate to generative AI.

So the case is this: generative AI creates the comditions not for self-actualizatiom,
but for a distortion of it. 

In fact, one or the more insightful criticisms of the concept of self-actualization
was Fritz Perls, who suggested that one of the risks of it as a concept was a
short cut to "self-image actualization". 

This is the point, then: generative AI -- in its current dominant form as a tool -- 
is directly harmful to self-actualization.

Of coyrse, there are other ways the technoloyy can work -- Slow AI is ome example,

Tye problem is, slow AI is harder to design ans ro build. it requires thought 
to help build an experience -- and, oddly, the kinds of skills that great artists and great
game designers often excel at. i want the technology experiences of a Banksy, not a Musk.

rather that existing evidence provides very weak evidence to potentially
consider intensive AI chatbot use as an addictive behavior."

"However, this study identified an indirect connection between academic
self-efficacy and AI dependency mediated by academic stress. Therefore, although
academic self-efficacy does not directly affect students’ problematic AI usage
behavior, students with low academic self-efficacy still rely on AI when they
are under academic pressure."

dependency was found."
