title: Super size my brain: self-actualization and AI
---

When I hear the increasing stories of the effects of large language models --
which increasingly seem to be transforming people's mental capacities in
ways that are obviously harmful -- I wonder if there's a useful analogy with
Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me"?

In effect, is there a kind of “cognitive diet” that can be good — or bad — for
us? Can we end up consuming information in a way that slowly poisons us,
destroying our ability to function independently. 

In effect, are our mental capacities malleable or not? 

If they are malleable -- what if they are capable of being damaged by certain
processes and stimuli?[^trauma]

[^trauma]: Let's leave trauma out of this, and focus more on more everyday
experiences.



Next, addiction. THere certainly is evidence that a kind of addiction to large
language models both exists and [can be
measured](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401225000209).

"we are not saying that problematic use of AI chatbots does not exist, but
rather that existing evidence provides very weak evidence to potentially
consider intensive AI chatbot use as an addictive behavior."

"However, this study identified an indirect connection between academic
self-efficacy and AI dependency mediated by academic stress. Therefore, although
academic self-efficacy does not directly affect students’ problematic AI usage
behavior, students with low academic self-efficacy still rely on AI when they
are under academic pressure."

"However, a significant relationship between performance expectations and AI
dependency was found."
