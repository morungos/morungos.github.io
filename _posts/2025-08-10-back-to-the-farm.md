# Back to the farm

Today, we are bombarded with parallels between technology -- especially
artificial intelligence -- and the industrial revolution. [McKinsey has called
AI the "Fourth Industrial
Revolution"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/adopting-ai-at-speed-and-scale-the-4ir-push-to-stay-competitive).
Trump's White House also uses this analogy in its ["Winning the Race" AI action
plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf).
Demis Hassabis, founder of Google's Deep Mind, says claimed that artificial
intelligence will be ["10 times bigger than the industrial revolution -- and
maybe 10 times
faster"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/demis-hassabis-ai-future-10-times-bigger-than-industrial-revolution-and-10-times-faster). 

Is this analogy, to quote the late, great, Douglas Adams, "a load of dingo's
kidneys"? I think so, and here's why.

## The agricultural revolution
Just before the Industrial Revolution got under way, an earlier dramatic social
and economic change had just taken place. [Another revolution, in
agriculture](https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/87910/student/?section=1),
and another dramatic sequence of reforms, including, among others, enclosures
and large-scale trade networks, that  reshaped society, and especially
employment. 

Innovations, such as drainage[^1], introduced new ways to improve the
productivity of the land. New crops were introduced, like potatoes. This cycle
of land improvement and crop innovation led to a process of consolidation, where
land -- especially what had been less productive land that had previously been
shared -- was enclosed and became the exclusive property of larger landowners.
Large landowners became larger, tenant farmers — previously the main driver of
productivity— became less important. A transportation system emerged, allowing
goods to be traded outside the local area. 

The net result was that fewer labourers were needed to farm the same land for
the same level of productivity. Many were displaced, forced to move off the
land, either to cities or even overseas. eventually forming the workforce needed
to drive the later Industrial Revolution.[^colonialism] 

## Meet Patrick Sellar
As a child with family roots in Scotland, I was regularly told stories of one of
the more ignominious characters: Patrick Sellar, factor of the Sutherland
Estates in northern Scotland. Sellar was from a farm labourers’ family, a
self-made man, lawyer, beneficiary of a Scottish educational system that was
surprisingly good at enabling social mobility on occasion.

Sellar’s view throughout was that evicting people from the land and replacing
them by sheep was, in fact, morally correct, a Good Thing[^2]. Displacement was
the right course of action. His “modern” world, shaped by the views of Adam
Smith — a contemporary of Sellar and key influencer of the Scottish
Enlightenment — was that these skills no longer had value in Scotland. (And that
in Canada and elsewhere, they might.) Displacement was the invisible hand,
pushing the farm labourers into a different and more productive life.[^smith]

Whatever his views, Sellar’s methods in the Clearances — and those of his
contemporaries — were brutal. [Sellar literally burned out
villages.](https://www.electricscotland.com/history/sclearstrath.htm) To this
day, Strathnaver has an eerie silence among the stone walls of the old villages,
and Sellar remains the face of the Clearances and associated with the desolation
that remains today. 

## Displacement 
Displacement, then, is not a new phenomenon. To this day we live with questions
of how to handle an old industry that has, in effect, become non-viable. The
same discussions happened about coal mining in the 1980s. 

Instead, displacement is the traditionally Conservative response to a changed
economy. It is an incentive for workers with obsolete skills to retrain
themselves for this new world. In this framing, displacement is to be welcomed,
not avoided. It should not be a surprise that the same framing is being applied
to today’s programmers, call centre workers, and even artists. Of course, that
doesn't make it right. 

As with other displacements, and as with Sellar, it is hard to disentangle the
desire for self-aggrandizement from the belief in a greater good. Sellar himself
grew wealthy as a tenant sheep farmer among the ruins of the villages he had
burned. When I look at the White House AI Action Plan, I see McKinsey, DOGE and
their ilk as a modem Patrick Sellar — I am sure they genuinely believe COBOL
programmers should learn AI, but I am equally sure they want to be the vendors.
Displacement of others is good for business. 

## The technology sector and agriculture compared

There are notable parallels between the systemic structures of today's
technology sector and the transformed agricultural world. As today's technology
sector has leveraged local monopolistic power to consolidate wealth and power in
the hands of a few individuals and corporations, so enclosure and displacement
had the same effect in agriculture.

| Agriculture    | Technology                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Landowners     | Investors, multinational corporations  |
| Tenant farmers | Small companies                        |
| Labourers      | Employees                              |
{: .table .table-condensed .table-striped}


At the top of today’s technology sector is a small cadre of investors, the likes
of Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Marc Andreesen, Mark Zuckerberg, Larrys
Page and Ellison, but there are many others. These correspond to traditional
landowners. They directly control most of the wealth and assets -- and set the
rules for the participation of others. They are, by and large, beyond regulation
-- to all intents and purposes, they are the regulators.

Subordinate to the investors are companies, of two types. The very large
companies (“Big Tech”, e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and so on) are effectively
landowners in their own right. They are active consolidators, acquiring and
dominating the more productive entities within their sphere of influence, 

Smaller companies have a very different relationship. They are effectively
subordinate to the investor class. They correspond to tenant farmers in
agriculture. The wealth of the investors depends on them, and they in turn
depend on rights provided by their owners. They have surprisingly little
autonomy. 

And finally, at the bottom of the pyramid, the employees are the labourers. They
do not, in fact, own the products of their labour, but they are paid solely for
the value of their effort in production. This is where displacement happens. 


## The technology sector as a property system
So I for one do not believe the parallels with the Industrial Revolution are
particularly useful. The Industrial Revolution did not really *cause* mass
displacement, it recruited from the earlier one.

No, what we are face with is a [second phase of
modernization](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/risk-society/book203184), where
industry is being transformed in the same way that agriculture was before the
Industrial Revolution. The displacement is the displacement of the workers of
industry, and I don’t believe anyone has a clue how this will play out socially. 

It’s worth noting that a “technology sector” as a concept is a relatively new
phenomenon. The word itself was scarcely used during the Industrial Revolution
and only truly gained prominence after the Second War. Although the concept of
technology existed long before that, the first glimmerings of what might become
today's technology sector arose after the Second War, in the likes of IBM.
Before that, although research organizations (such as Edison's Menlo Park
laboratory) did exist, they were vendors. They didn't aim to replace systems
themselves the way the likes of Amazon and Uber try to today. 

As in the agricultural revolution, the transformation of participants from
passive participants in existing economies to active creators of new ones, that
was a relatively speedy process. As in the agricultural revolution, the same
processes of consolidation are at play today. Technology's big estates are
growing and becoming more and more powerful. 

If you don’t believe me, think about YouTube, for one. It has strong parallels
to a landed estate. Monetization algorithms change at the whims of the owners.
Rules are entirely controlled by the owners. And yet, it is the labourers within
the “YouTube Estate” that are generating all the revenues that they benefit
from. 

## Artificial intelligence and transformation
So where does artificial intelligence fit in this? We can see the narrative of
displacement is already a force to be reckoned with. We can see that the number of 
actual vendors in the space is relatively small -- as with industry, wealth itself
limits modernization to the wealthy. 

And I, for one, brought up on stories of the Clearances, and with memories of
Strathnaver in its aftermath, look on those who eagerly promote displacement as
the descendants of Patrick Sellar: people who would burn down your house in their
search for profit, while firmly believing that it is all in your own interests.

## Notes

[^1]: I was inspired to think about the analogy with agriculture, by my dad, who
    has recently become fascinated by the uptake of farm drainage on Islay, and
    the subsequent changes in field boundaries and estate management. So many
    thanks to him. 

[^2]: Readers of old books of British humour might notice this allusion to “1066
    And All That”, which was written by Sellar’s grandson, W. C. Sellar.

[^colonialism]: The links with colonialism are significant — perhaps inevitably,
    given that colonialism was a direct product of this process of
    modernization. Significant displacement happened within nations as well as
    beyond them. Scottish crofters have a lot more in common with First Nations 
    than meets the eye. 

[^smith]: It is not unlikely that Adam Smith would have disapproved of Sellar's
    actions -- he was surprisingly positive about unions, for example.
