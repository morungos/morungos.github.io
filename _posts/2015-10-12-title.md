As a cognitive scientist, I've long been influenced by George Lakoff's work on
the fundamental importance of metaphors and framing on the way we think about
social issues. I'd also like to give a shout-out to Michael Reddy, whose
groundbreaking paper on (The Conduit Metaphor)[http://www.biolinguagem.com/ling_cog_cult/reddy_1979_conduit_metaphor.pdf]
started a lot of this, significantly
influencing Lakoff and Johnson's work, and certainly shaped the way I think about
learning to this way.

However, it's certainly open to criticism:

Lakoff has written three books applying cognitive science to politics:
(Moral Politics : How Liberals and Conservatives Think, 2002)[http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Politics-Liberals-Conservatives-Think/dp/0226467716],
(Don't Think Of An Elephant!, 2005)[http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Think-Elephant-Democrats-Progressives/dp/1931498822], and
(The Political Mind: A Cognitive Scientist's Guide to Your Brain and Its Politics, 2008)[http://www.amazon.com/Political-Mind-Cognitive-Scientists-Politics-ebook/dp/B0017T0B2U].

His point is a simple one: it's about framing:

> "Framing is not primarily about politics or political messaging or communication.
> It is far more fundamental than that: frames are the mental structures that allow
> human beings to understand reality – and sometimes to create what we take to be
> reality. But frames do have an enormous bearing on politics … they structure our
> ideas and concepts, they shape the way we reason … For the most part, our use of
> frames is unconscious and automatic." [Source](http://t.co/5xOZDhsyoq)

To choose a simple example (outside politics) let's take one conceptual metaphor:
ARGUMENT IS WAR. It's reflected in statements like "I'll win the argument" and
"Your claims are indefensible". It shapes a discussion as a battle between conflicting
ideas. It's not the only way of thinking about an argument: it can also be seen
as a journey ("I'm not following you"), or as a building ("You're on shaky foundations").
But the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor carries the baggage of arguments being fought,
conflicting, with winners and losers.

Changing frames (see Reddy's paper on the Conduit Metaphor for an example, mentioned earlier)
literally changes the way people think about issues. And Lakoff's point
is that this applies to political issues, like the relationship between individuals
and states, taxes, healthcare, defence, and so on.

Lakoff's primary discussion focuses mostly on two competing frames for the relationship between
individual and state, variants on a conceptual metaphor NATION-AS-FAMILY. He calls "Strict-Father"
and "Nurturant-Parent", and they differ in the type of family they describe. Is it a controlled
family with a single decider who is a voice of authority? Or is it a nurturing family with
parents that nurture and empower others?

This isn't necessarily a binary choice. There are many complex family structures that
could apply, such as communal forms (e.g., kibbutzim), extended family systems, feudal
structures, and so on.
Lakoff's point is a fairly simple one: the way power in the state is perceived will mirror the
way power in a family works. Not everyone thinks of the NATION-AS-FAMILY in the same way,
and the differences reflect cultural background. This is a fairly testable hypothesis.

So far, I haven't touched on religion, but let's go there. First of all, both Judaism
and Christianity have a more-or-less explicit second metaphor: GOD AS FATHER. Particularly and especially
in Christianity, particularly episcopal forms, authority can be a significant part of that.

Now for the second question: is Lakoff's model really American?

It's definitely true that Lakoff's books were written on US politics -- after all, he
is an American. That doesn't necessarily mean they don't generalise.

Many strict-father ideas have recently come to the fore in many states. These include:

 * Childen are born bad, and need discipline to become true adults
 *

Finally, the problem with NATION-AS-FAMILY is that it is a metaphor. Nations --
particularly and especially divided nations like federations -- are not at all
like a family. Here are some others:

 * NATION-AS-PERSON (in this sense, Putin *is* Russia, Saddam *was* Iraq)
 * NATION-AS-CORPORATION (e.g., "UK plc", "America, Incorporated")
 * NATION-AS-ACTO

Technically, the "Strict-Father" metaphor makes an analogy:
"FATHER : FAMILY :: GOVERNMENT : NATION"

In this sense, there is a GOVERNMENT-AS-PERSON and a GOVERNMENT-AS-AUTHORITY.
