We live in a world of frantic technological change, and everywhere we turn we
are bombarded with parallels between technology -- especially artificial
intelligence -- and the industrial revolution. [McKinsey has called AI the
"Fourth Industrial
Revolution"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/adopting-ai-at-speed-and-scale-the-4ir-push-to-stay-competitive).
Trump's White House also uses this analogy in its ["Winning the Race" AI action
plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf).
Demis Hassabis, founder of Google's Deep Mind, says claimed that artificial
intelligence will be ["10 times bigger than the industrial revolution -- and
maybe 10 times
faster"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/demis-hassabis-ai-future-10-times-bigger-than-industrial-revolution-and-10-times-faster). 

Is this argument, to quote the late, great, Douglas Adams, "a load of dingo's
kidneys"? I think so, and here's why.

## What was the industrial revolution?

The story behind the industrial revolution is part of the story of
modernization, of progress. An array of innovators, inventors, and entrepreneurs
created technical innovations that rapidly enhanced the productivity of
industrial work. [John Kay's "flying
shuttle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_shuttle) enabled a single weaver
to be twice as productive, so yarn became a pressing demand, James Hargreaves
"spinning jenny" helped the spinners able to produce multiple balls of yarn at
once, all with the assistance of water power -- and then steam power. Each
innovation pushed the demand to other critical parts of the overall value chain,
incentivizing synergistic innovations, and what once required hundreds of people
to produce could be the work of a few.

This is typical automation in manufacturing: using 'technology'[^Technology]
to improve productivity, or quality, or whatever else enabled higher prices and
higher margins for profit.

[^Technology]: The word "technology" here is anachronistic. The term wasn't used
    much until the 1940s and 1950s.

Together, the impact of the innovations was dependent on the transformation
from an earlier collective system, with carders and spinners creating the yarns
before it could be woven by the weavers, to be dyed, sold, and marketed by
others, before finally being transformed into wearable garments. Hundreds of
people might be involved in a single shirt.

This was the industrial revolution, like a fire, it gradually spread from sector
to sector, transforming processes through innovation, consuming the old traditional
ways and leaving a new, transformed, recognizable global economy in its wake.

## Artificial intelligence

Although artificial intelligence has only recently become a global phenomenon,
automation was a significant part of its 

Today's artificial intelligence is not interested in manufacturing -- instead,
it is firmly oriented to the service sector[^Robots].

[^Robots]: Yes, robots have played a huge part in industry since the 1970s --
    and these robots are the lineal descendants of the spinning jenny, no more.
    So much so that nobody is really interested in putting today's artificial
    intelligence inside any of them -- except, maybe, in a very few complex and
    high risk settings, where they may be able to reduce risks for people.

## The Agricultural Revolution

Behind the industrial revolution was a social transformation. Look at how the
textile industry changed, from a network of individual and skilled tradespeople
into a structured system. Skills changed, and the revenue associated with it
flowed elsewhere.
