  As modern society becomes increasingly complex, artificial intelligence

  cognitive challenges.

We live in a world of frantic technological change, and everywhere we turn we
are bombarded with parallels between technology -- especially artificial
intelligence -- and the industrial revolution. [McKinsey has called AI the
"Fourth Industrial
Revolution"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/adopting-ai-at-speed-and-scale-the-4ir-push-to-stay-competitive).
Trump's White House also uses this analogy in its ["Winning the Race" AI action
plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf).
Demis Hassabis, founder of Google's Deep Mind, says claimed that artificial
intelligence will be ["10 times bigger than the industrial revolution -- and
maybe 10 times
faster"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/demis-hassabis-ai-future-10-times-bigger-than-industrial-revolution-and-10-times-faster). 

Is this argument, to quote the late, great, Douglas Adams, "a load of dingo's
kidneys"? I think so, and here's why.

## 1. Modernization

Over the past five centuries or so, particularly in the Western
world[^Modernity], there was a clear break from the medieval world, with its
strict hierarchies and agricultural economies. While the modern world did not
arrive all at once, piece by piece a series of innovations transformed the world
into the modern, industrialized, interconnected one that we see today.

Throughout that transformation there was a theme of *progress* -- a marked break
from the medieval world, where people were the subjects of God, nature, and our
lords and masters. In the medieval world, what technological innovation there
was (not much!) was firmly under the control of the Church and the nobles. 

The modern world changed that — progress itself became a Good Thing. We could
start to shape our environment, make a new and better world, improved over the
one that we inherited from our forbears. Along the way, we developed
technologies that both helped us shape the world, and they, in turn, laid the
foundations for the innovations yet to come.

[^Modernity]: 
    Yes, this is a more-than-a-little colonialist way of summarizing it —
    perhaps inevitably, given that colonialism was a direct product of this
    process of modernization. It is also likely that the key phases were
    directly shaped by forces elsewhere — in particular, the Islamic Golden Age
    presaged early modernization by over a hundred years. 

The peak of this process was the industrial revolution that we know and 
love -- especially those in my home town of Manchester.
