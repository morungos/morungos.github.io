  Artificial intelligence has a power problem, and we need to think of it
  as a trickster character, one that can cause chaos and abuse, but —
  properly channeled — has the potential to expose and confront those abuses

Artificial intelligence has a power problem. Look at the modern trends to:

 * ["Bossware" applications](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/inside-invasive-secretive-bossware-tracking-workers), 
   [sold to managers to keep employees under control](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-employee-monitoring-software)<!-- more -->
 * Surveillance companies like [Palantir, building and mining vast datasets for 
   the benefits of the military and governments.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/30/palantir-peter-thiel-cia-data-crime-police)
 * Gig economy companies like [Uber](https://www.dqindia.com/bizarre-case-uber-drivers-job-loss-faulty-artificial-intelligence-software/) and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/24/how-amazon-prevents-unions-by-surveilling-employee-activism.html), using AI to keep their workers
   financially in thrall to their work, without even the rights of employment.
 * Proctoring applications like [Proctorio, threatening 
   students with disciplining for 
   looking the wrong way during an exam](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus).

In all of these, AI is exploiting the more vulnerable members of society, 
while maintaining the power and wealth of an elite. 

In all of my applications, I've hoped to *punch up*, designing applications that help individuals
resist the power complexities of their world and workplaces. As I said about 
educational technology:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">
  My rule has always been: ed tech needs to be like comedy — always punch up, never punch down. Empower those without power, or you’re doing it wrong.</p>&mdash; Stuart Watt (@morungos) <a href="https://twitter.com/morungos/status/1372709992919400450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2021</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Comedy can break this rule. [The trickster](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/trickster) can
confront and ignore social rules, and that's [a large part of what keeps society
vibrant and effective](https://www.routledge.com/The-Trickster-and-the-System-Identity-and-agency-in-contemporary-society/Bassil-Morozow/p/book/9780415507943).

The problem for AI is, it's more like [Mr Punch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_and_Judy) than modern comedy. like his
Italian original [Pulcinella](https://wepa.unima.org/en/pulcinella/) and 
French counterpart [Polichinelle](https://wepa.unima.org/en/polichinelle/), Mr Punch is an
ambiguous and violent character, both abusive and murderous. He's the ultimate trickster: to Mr Punch, anyone and anything is fair game, so long as he wins.

And [Mr Punch, intriguingly, is even performed by a "professor"](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/23/workandcareers4) -- just like AI
companies with their ["team of PhDs"](https://www.elementai.com/press-room/element-ai-receives-10-academic-paper-acceptances-for-neurips-2020-conference). 

Developers of AI applications have an ethical choice -- whose side are they on.
Are they helping those in wealth and power to continue? Are they creating
workplaces that resemble sausage machines? Or are they helping those in need,
the disadvantaged, those without the power to defend themselves against abuse.

In a word, are these applications [punching up or punching down?](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/why-punching-down-will-never-be-funny)

I have no sympathy for the AI trickster maintaining the power of those who
already have it, abusing the vulnerable, or simply acting as an agent of chaos.

But I have a lot of sympathy for the trickster when he's confronting or exposing 
abuse of power, or using his slapstick to beat the rich. 

As Mr Punch said: "That's the way to do it."
