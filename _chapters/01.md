## Risk machines

This is a story about technology, about how it made -- and broke -- the modern
world that we live in today. 

In many ways, this book is not about technology, but about society and how it is
shaped by machines. Or, strictly, not by machines themselves, but by the forces
those machines embody. 

I will be honest: I don’t know what kind of society we are creating. And I don’t
believe anyone else knows either. Many claim they do, but their visions resemble
science fiction more than reality. The flavour of science fiction they
anticipate varies widely according to the individual, from the fantastical
techno-utopianism of Musk to the dystopian of X. What they never come clean
about is why their vision is any more likely than anybody else’s — there’s never
a theory behind that.

So although I don’t want to paint a picture of the future, I do want to explore
the forces that are influencing its trajectory — and in particular, the process
of modernization, the force that created machines, and which, through machines,
is transforming the world we live in. 


## Artificial intelligence

It would be easy to focus too much on artificial intelligence as ‘the’
technology of risk, but that would be misleading. There are many different ways
that technology today shapes the social flow of risk, and much of it has nothing
to do with artificial intelligence. Cryptocurrencies introduce some fascinating
risks — through their determination that transactions cannot be reversed, even
if they are fundamentally fraudulent. Cellular phones enable our risks to follow
us around our daily lives, biotechnology means that risks can cross into the
realm of the biological, social media injects risks into our daily and intimate
social interactions. None of these are necessarily dependent on artificial
intelligence at all. However, what is special about artificial intelligence is
that it enables bespoke risks to be manufactured at scale, but still on a
personalized basis. This is new and unique. It is the ability of this specific
technology to tailor its behaviour to each person’s individual circumstances —
and to do so at global scale — that makes it such an important part of this new
phase of modernization. 

What makes artificial intelligence unique? 

If you ask ten artificial intelligence developers that question, you’ll probably
get eleven different answers. Some will emphasize its speed, others is ability
to learn from past examples, others its ability to (pretend to) creativity.  

Artificial intelligence plays a role similar to that mechanization in the early
Industrial Revolution. At that time, mechanization allowed human skills to be
captured and deployed at scale. This reduced the need for people with those
uniquely human skills, and enabled their previous employers to increase their
efficiency while reducing their costs. Commercially and economically, of course,
this makes perfect sense.

It also clarifies the relationship between economics and automation. Jobs aren’t
automated at random. The ones that are automated tend to be (a) simple enough to
automate, (b) costly enough that they are worth automating, and (c) in
sufficient demand that it’s worth investing in automation. All three factors
play a role. They aren’t precisely conditions, in the sense that they’re all
parts of a cost-benefit analysis, so simple tasks are more open to automation
anyway, even if they’re not as costly.

Artificial intelligence has always had a relationship with automation. This was
explicit, for example, even in 1973’s Lighthill Report, which was actually very
positive about the impacts that AI had already had on automation. That field of
work was expected to continue. 

What artificial intelligence brought was a change in what could be automated. Up
to that point, it had generally been routine manual skilled work that had been
automated. Tasks like cotton spinning and textile weaving were among the first,
but as the 19th century turned to the 20th, that gradually expanded to
machining, assembly, agriculture, mining, and so on. By the 1980s,
industrialization had reached a point that the need for skilled employees was
very significantly reduced, and entire economies began to move away from
manufacturing and towards services.

So how does automation work in services? Perhaps the first widespread innovation
of that kind was the banking automated teller machines, which started to achieve
widespread impacts in the late 1970s. This was among the first machines that
took a very specific human task — dispensing cash from bank accounts — and
automated it. In doing so, it created a whole set of new risks. Indeed, plastic
cards for banking demonstrated exactly the kind of risk movement that Ulrich
Beck describes. Personal information number (PIN) authorization allows the banks
to say that if a card is used fraudulently, then it’s the customer’s
responsibility to prove that it was fraudulent, where up to that point, the
banks had been liable. A new risk is created (people stealing the PINs and using
cards fraudulently) and that risk flows away from the large and powerful bank to
the individual customer.

Another interesting precursor to the automation of services is credit scoring.
This time, what is automated is not a simple transfer of money from an
electronic account to physical cash. This time, it’s a decision! At around the
time time the ATM was going mainstream, computing technology also consolidated
thousands of small credit bureaus, each with their own paper-based filing
systems, into a few large organizations with information retrieval technologies.
Today’s credit scores are built on that, and essentially provide a simple code
which quantifies someone’s financial risk. If you have a sufficiently good
score, an automated system may even offer loans directly, without a human
review. 

Now you might think that this is simply statistics, but trust me: credit scoring
grew directly out of artificial intelligence[^Disclaimer]. In fact, credit scoring is an
excellent early example of machine learning. 

[^Disclaimer]:
    I have personally worked with artificial intelligence researchers who
    developed credit scoring.

But the humble ATM was just the beginning. What artificial intelligence allows
is far more powerful decision-making. Instead of managing credit, today,
artificial intelligence may be used in decisions that affect hiring, career
progression, healthcare, education.

Perhaps more interesting is that credit scoring actually grew out of regulation.
It was also expensive, both to develop and to manage. Although the artificial
intelligence techniques of the time (which were, notably, statistics and expert
systems) were deeply involved, expert systems in particular are both expensive
and complex to build. They’re expensive because they require costly technical
people and costly experts to spend time together, not doing their normal jobs,
but analyzing the decisions the experts make in sufficient that they can be
automated. In effect, they involve the kinds of time and motion study used in
early 20th century scientific management, but on tasks that are an order of
magnitude more complicated. They’re complex because they need to be good enough
to match up to performance of the human expertise, which is not an easy goal to
achieve.

The modern changes in artificial intelligence, and in particular the advent of
more powerful approaches to machine learning, radically change the economics
compared to the era of expert systems. In particular, it doesn’t demand large
amounts of expert time. Instead, the algorithms can work directly with the same
information the experts receive, and the decisions that they make. All that data
can be cleaned and used to build a predictive model for a fraction of the cost
of an expert system, and usually greater reliability in the process. That’s in
the nature of machine learning: by and large, unusual cases are less surprising
when a system has been trained on a relatively large amount of data, compared to
when rules are assembled by hand by experts reviewing a relatively small amount
of data in depth.

However, all the issues raised by credit scoring algorithms in the 1980s haven’t
gone away. Essentially the same issues — bias, predictability, potential for
harms such as redlining — these all still exist.

Credit scoring also exemplifies modernization. Before the new systems were
introduced, credit scoring was based on human judgement. It was fragmented
across hundreds, maybe thousands, of credit offices. And so was the data, which
was stored on paper in good old-fashioned filing cabinets. During the process,
technology integrated the data, computerized it for access and analysis, and
developed new methods of identifying which features were effective for
prediction. The result, a sort of hybrid of statistical analysis and human
expert rules of thumb, could scale up to handle hundreds of decisions a second.
And, by building on science, those decisions themselves were more consistent and
less likely to run foul of government regulations and legal challenges.
