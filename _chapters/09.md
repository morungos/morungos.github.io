## Intellectual property and modernization

One of the biggest factors enabling modernization was the development and
evolution of a new kind of property -- intellectual property. If I grow a box of
potatoes and trade it, the person who buys is now the new owner of the potatoes,
but I have something else in return. This trade enables people to use their
expertise in a way that everybody gains. Intellectual property creates some new
rules that allow us to trade in things that aren't physical objects, like ideas,
words, songs, and inventions.

If I write a book and sell it, while — just like the potatoes — I no longer own
the physical book itself. But, the book is not only a physical object, it also
contains my thoughts, my ideas. It would be a problem if the person I sold my book to
could just print a thousand copies and sell them -- they would be the one benefiting
from all my work. So, intellectual property rights create a fair system that
enables a trade in ideas and inventions. 

For example, copyright means that without my permission, nobody else can print
the book and sell it. These are the “economic rights”. But what I can do, I can
‘sell’[^Sell] my economic rights to a book to the publisher, and then they own
the rights, and can more or less do what they like. Economic rights are usually
time-limited, so eventually they expire and the works become free.  

[^Sell]: Whether you can really sell a piece of intellectual property depends on the
    jurisdiction and the type of property. In some places, all you can do is
    sell a license to the use the property, along with a contractual obligation
    not to use it yourself. In others, you really can sell your stake in the
    property.

A second feature of copyright is that I keep the right to be identified as the
author, this is one of a few “moral rights” — at least, that’s the way it works
in most of the world. So, even if they do own the right to sell, the publisher
can’t simply put someone else’s name on the book. I also keep the right to
protect the integrity of the work. In other words, if the publisher’s
exploitation of the economic rights (which they may have paid for) affects my
reputation, as an author, I can use my moral rights to step in. In some places,
like the US, moral rights can be waived (effectively, legally promising never to
use them), but in others, such as much of Europe, they cannot be waived. 

This fair system makes trade in ideas and inventions possible. It is not a
stretch to say that without intellectual property rights, capitalism itself, as
we know it today, could not exist.

And this makes sense: if people are to survive in any other way than by growing
all their own potatoes, the risks associated with other forms of production have
to be contained. And that is what intellectual property does. 

But obviously kings don't have the time to print books -- or the expertise, for
that matter. The solution was for the monarchs to grant permission to use
printing presses to an elite group which would be under their control, in the
form of a power which could be recalled if required. These permissions from
sovereigns were 'letters patent', patent meaning "open", as these letters were
intended to be used to verify the authority to print. These early letters patent
evolved into the systems for granting rights to exploit inventions that we still
use today.

In some cases, these assets are entirely manufactured. Domain names are a good 
example. Once the domain name system was invented, it enabled an almost infinite
variety of domain names to be created and owned.
