If there is a unique feature to the new millennium, it is the way that
encryption has enabled one of the most strikingly powerful examples of creative
destruction that we have ever seen. In fact, encryption is old — the true
innovation is what’s known as “asymmetric encryption”, which allow us, if you
like, to keep our private keys private, and therefore overcome (for the most
part) the trust problem. In effect, most of the technologies that drive the way
technologies are reshaping the world we live in depend on encryption in one way
or another.

What encryption provides is a way for us to select who can receive our
communications in the digital world. In the physical world, we rely on secrecy.
If I speak in a small room with walls, I generally assume that nobody outside
the room can really know what’s going on. The digital world does not have any
walls, for example, every email I send is sent as clear text. Encryption
provides what Erving Goffman calls an “involvement shield”, rather like a
bedroom, a bathroom, or a mask, it provides a way to selectively hide what we do
from other people.

And it is not a coincidence that so many of the applications are financial.
Finance has depended for centuries on secrets of one kind or another, whether it
is your Roman signet ring or where you hide your cash. Encryption provides a
ready means for improving these, and reducing the risks to everyone involved in
a transaction. The idea of using cryptographic techniques to build a currency
seemed a natural one.

## Tokens

In one sense, alternative forms of currency are nothing new. At the beginning of
the industrial revolution, there was a significant shortage of small
denomination coins — the sizes that were needed to pay workers. This was
particularly true in the industrializing North — the government did not
distribute pennies -- the unit of currency needed to pay workers' wages --
outside London, and even stopped making them entirely in 1775[^Minting].

[^Minting]: 
    This was, of course, before the industrial revolution. At the time, coins
    were literally made by hand, so a dramatic growth in demand could create a
    burden on state currency production. Eventually, mechanization caught up
    with minting coins, and the new steam power technology transformed the
    process, and a new generation of copper coins started to appear in 1789,
    with tokens becoming illegal (as currency) in the 1820s.

As a result, employers began to make their own “token” coins, which could then
be accepted and traded in the local community. Possibly the best-known example
is that of the Parys Mountain mining company, based on Ynys Môn (in English:
Anglesey), at the time the largest copper mine in Europe. They minted about 200
tons of pennies (“Druids” — due to the picture of a druid on one side) over
about thirty years.

Switch to an image of several of the tokens from my collection. I have the 
druid, but I have a few others that are just as intriguing. Also, we should 
work to be safe from copyrighting. This image is a placeholder.

Of course, the idea of an alternative currency, one existing outside the reach
of government regulation — and even to compensate for the disadvantages of
government — was not over!



## Networked money

With the advent of modernization, international borders started to call, and
currency was no exception. Except, that is, for governments. Each country had
its own currency, and sending money between countries involved either suitcases
or international banks, both with significant costs or risks. There was an
opening for a way to send money between countries electronically.
