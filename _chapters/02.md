These technologies include:

* Cryptography
* Information retrieval
* Digital rights management
* Smart cards
* 3-D printing
* Internet of things
* Genome sequencing
* Artificial intelligence

Although these are very different technologies, they form an interesting cluster
-- all of them move risks around in economically important ways. They are also
*technologies of individualization*. What do we mean by this?

Back in the middle of the 20th Century, industrial innovation was based on
"scaling up". Ford could make cars more cheaply because they were all the same. 
Parts became standardized. These economies of scale made a big difference to
costs, but they came with one consequence: the range of products shrank. 
This process is still going on in manufacturing, as corporations consolidate
and merge.

But in services, economies of scale can be limiting. If, for example, you're
building web sites for people, or handling their bank accounts, or handling
their tax filing, or teaching, there are hard limits. People are unique, all
different and in different situations, so a new kind of technology is needed, a
technology that embraces and improves efficiencies even with these individual
differences. These technologies mean that two different people using the 
same services can get appropriately distinct provisions.

Risk technologies enable this level of individualization. Cryptography allows
one internet service to authenticate and manage people uniquely -- it's
fundamental. It even enables us to know for certain that our credit card
information is being sent to people we trust, and not scammers. Digital 
rights management technology builds on this, so that someone paying access
to a movie can see it, but those who didn't pay, can't. Smart phones and 
the internet of things bring technology to a personal level: my smart
watch can track my unique fitness -- even though the device itself gains
from benefits of scale, the data and services are individualized.

3-D printing extends this into manufacturing. Where historically making a 
one-off product was prohibitively expensive, because it involved lots of
manual effort, 3-D printing makes it possible to make one-offs relatively 
cheaply -- dental aligners are an excellent example. 

In this society, an inverted kind of 'trickle-down economics' happens by
default, risks generally do tend to flow down from the most powerful to the
least powerful, and especially from corporations to individuals. As the old
military saying does, "shit rolls downhill".

What's really interesting is that in a risk society, risks become more
economically significant than conventional goods. We can see the signs of 
this in the 2008 financial derivatives collapse where, put simply, risky
investments were concealed from buyers, until a critical point was reached 
where those risks destroyed much of the wider financial system. 

But it goes beyond that. There is a saying, especially in the tech sector: "if
you’re not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the
product"[^SayingCredit]. But is this true? In a purely monetary sense, yes, but
risk society adds a new dimension to it. If we think about the relationship as
one that includes risks as well as money, we can interpret it differently.

[^SayingCredit]: This formulation of the phrase is by Andrew Lewis, and
    popularized by technology publisher Tim O’Reilly in 2010. However, the
    framing likely originated in a 1973 artwork by Richard Serra and Carlota Fay
    Schoolman, “Television Delivers People”, which included messages like "you
    are the end product".

What, after all, is advertising? It is, basically, a way to reduce the risks of
selling a product or a service -- a product is more likely to make money if it
is advertised. If you think about it, advertising is more about reducing the
risk of losing money than it is about making money. We are not only the product,
the risks of buying what people want to sell are being passed onto us, as
members of the audience. 

In this sense, it is no coincidence that the big technology companies, such as
Google and Meta, came to dominate the world of advertising.


When we think like this, we need to remember, as Beck says, that risks are not
universally bad things. A new product may be great, it may improve our lives
significantly. In a sense, risks are the fuel as well as the product of
progress and innovation.

The second point is that although we tend to think about "big" risks, the 
important aspect of risk technologies like these is that they enable risks to
be broken up into tiny pieces and distributed. People think about big risks 
and small risks in very different ways, so this use of technology is
truly transformative. 

Let's take an example. Back in the olden days, some of the biggest financial
risks were borne by the institutions. They could be robbed by Butch and 
Sundance, or they could crash. Either would obviously be bad for customers,
but shareholders and owners would be hit particularly hard. Governments and
regulators would set rules which would aim to protect customers, 

Now look at modern banking. Large scale bank robberies are now extremely
rare -- technology has provided solutions to improve security. But individualized
fraud is widespread. 

In effect, the big risks have been broken up into small pieces, and through
technologies like smart cards, and through laws and policies too, the fragments
have been offloaded onto customers and clients. This fragmentation and
individualization of risk is a distinctive part of risk society, and 

## Cryptography

Although cryptography is, in one form or another, millennia old, a thoroughly 
modern set of asymmetric technologies for it emerged in the middle of the
20th Century. 



## Smart cards

The humble smart card is a beautiful innovation -- embedding within a small and
portable piece of plastic a tiny chip that allows secret information to be
stored and verified in tamper-proof ways. As a replacement for openly readable
magnetic strips, they make it more or less impossible for a nefarious individual
to copy the card. As this was one of the biggest risks for fraud, that was a
huge innovation. 

But smart cards had wider applications than that. Because they provided a
relatively cheap but unique and hard to copy thing, they also enabled cable TV
companies to lock services[^Murdoch]. If a customer, Sam, paid for premium channels, their
smart card could ensure that only they could receive those channels, while 
another customer, Pat, *while receiving exactly the same information through the 
cable*, could not. Again, it's an application of asymmetric cryptography that 
enables a service to be made truly individual. 

[^Murdoch]: As I say, "hard to copy", smart cards could be hacked, especially in
    the early days. Indeed, one digital TV company in the UK was impacted by
    loss of revenue, about 8% of viewers were using hacked and fraudulent smart
    cards to access the service. The company eventually failed, and while there
    were questionable links between those who hacked the cards and the company's 
    main competitor, Murdoch's Sky TV, it's unlikely that the hacked cards were
    significant factors in its downfall.

## Digital rights management

At first blush, this is a simple application of cryptography, but its impact
on how risks are distributed is significant.

Stepping back, before the digital revolution, there was no technology that
prevented the copying of media. If you bought a vinyl album, it was a
straightforward matter to copy it onto a cassette, or digitize it into MP3
files. This was, for music publishers especially, a significant risk. 
Piracy was a threat to their business. 

As the music industry integrated more vertically, companies like Sony
controlled hardware as well as music publishing, and were in a position
where their technical reach and their property rights interests started
to align. The Sony MiniDisc was a wonderful innovation, but since Sony
intentionally disabled digital output from their recorders...
