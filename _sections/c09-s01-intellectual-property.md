The history of our modern world is interwoven with the evolution of
a new kind of property -- intellectual property. Copyright, patents,
trademarks, and an array of similar concepts have allowed us to 
move beyond 

Without intellectual property, capitalism itself would not exist.

And this makes sense: if people are to survive in any other way than by
producing their own food, the risks associated with other forms of production
have to be contained. And that is what intellectual property does. 

Let's look at copyright as an example. Before copyright existed, printing
presses were a form of power so substantial they were reserved to monarchs. 

But obviously kings don't have the time to print books -- or the expertise, for
that matter. The solution was for the monarchs to grant permission to use
printing presses to an elite group which would be under their control, in the
form of a power which could be recalled if required. These permissions from
sovereigns were 'letters patent', patent meaning "open", as these letters were
intended to be used to verify the authority to print. These early letters patent
evolved into the systems for granting rights to exploit inventions that we still
use today.
