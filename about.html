  I am a cognitive scientist and professional software developer with years of
  experience researching and developing intelligent systems for complex, data-rich
  applications. I have worked in fields ranging from business and psychology, art and 
  philosophy, to technology and healthcare, and have more than eighty peer-reviewed 
  publications across these fields.

  I am currently co-founder and chief technology officer for <a href="https://turalt.com">Turalt</a>,
  bringing together AI and cognitive models to give people real-time feedback, advice, and analytics 
  on their email communication. I also run <a href="https://meetomatic.com">Meet-O-Matic</a>, the
