<p>
  I am a transdisciplinary systems architect, product designer, developer, and researcher in intelligent 
  technology, underpinned by deep knowledge and experience across computing, artificial intelligence,
  cognition, the social sciences, and bioinformatics. My expertise ranges from business and psychology, art and
  philosophy, to technology and healthcare, and I have over 20 years of 
  experience researching, designing, and developing intelligent systems for complex, data-rich
  applications across these fields. As a highly experienced professional developer with a product-centred
  focus, I have a proven record transforming concepts into successfully adopted and implemented solutions that
  are usable, performant, and engineered to industry standards.
