title: About me: Stuart Watt
---

<p>
I am a cognitive scientist and professional software developer with years of
experience researching and developing intelligent systems for complex, data-rich
applications. I have worked in fields ranging from art and philosophy, business
and psychology, to technology and healthcare, and have more than sixty
peer-reviewed publications across these fields. I currently work for the
University Health Network, where my experience in the practice of modern
development techniques and the successful design and deployment of usable
systems is helping build a range of mobile and web-based decision-support
systems to assist in healthcare.
