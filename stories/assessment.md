When I worked in academia, one of the areas I was early involved with
was using artificial intelligence in assessment. 

## Annotated bibliography

An analysis of the language of feedback, using an interaction model. The short
version is: we found very strong systematic associations between certain
*categories* of comment (e.g., asking questions) and the derived grade. This
allowed us to develop later tools that help support and train tutors, for
example: if a tutor asked too many questions it might not give the same
impression as the grade awarded. This kind of AI -- designed only for helping
tutors learn to give quality feedback -- remains under-explored within
educational technology.

This article describes a method for surveying students and automating the
generation of high-quality course evaluation reports. Its most significant
technical innovation was a reporting system that integrated narrative text,
analysis, and charting, so that high-quality reports could be produced in
seconds. We assessed this approach comparing its advantages and disadvantages to
traditional surveying.
