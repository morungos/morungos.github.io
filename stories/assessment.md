When I worked in academia, one of the areas I was early involved with
was using artificial intelligence in assessment.

This article describes a method for surveying students and automating the
generation of high-quality course evaluation reports. Its most significant
technical innovation was a reporting system that integrated narrative text,
analysis, and charting, so that high-quality reports could be produced in
seconds. We assessed this approach comparing its advantages and disadvantages to
traditional surveying.
