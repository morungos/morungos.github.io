Most of the time, dual Canadian-UK citizenship is straightforward. It means I can 
easily travel to or through the US, as well as visit the UK. The only real rule is 
whenever you land in a country where you are a citizen, you need to fly there on
that country's passport. 

This means if you travel from Canada to the UK via the US, you are in the amusing 
situation of travelling to the US on a Canadian passport, and to the UK on the UK
one. Yes, you really switch passport at the transit point -- at least, that's what
US border folks told me to do, anyway. Usual caveats, blah blah blah.

So, this rule: whenever you land in a country where you are a citizen, you need to fly there on
that country's passport works great until you don't have one of your key passports.
You can literally be stuck, unable to travel without emergency documents and 
major extra hassle and expense. 

So you can imagine my surprise at my latest UK passport renewal when they told me,
no, I couldn't have a UK passport - **unless I change the name on my Canadian passport**.

This was news to me, and somewhat staggering. So, here's the story in case it's useful
to anyone else.

Somewhat unusually, I was given four names at birth.

1. A first name: "Stuart"
2. A second name: "Neil" (anglicized from the title character of Njal's Saga)
3. A third name: "Kennaway", originally my grandmother's maiden name, now a family traditional name
4. A family name

So far, so good. These exist everywhere, I have used all of them, no problems. 

And then I immigrate to Canada, initially as a temporary foreign worker, and 
after a few years, apply for permanent residence. 

Interestingly, on my formal confirmation of permanent residence in 2011, the third
name "Kennaway" is classed as a "flag name", not as a given name or a family name. I genuinely
don't really know what this means, even today. As far as I can tell, the only 
organization that uses the concept of "flag names" on the surface of the world
is Canadian immigration. But such is life. I have no idea what this means. 

Time passes, and I am eligible for citizenship, so I apply without delay -- after all,
I don't want the rules to change and I was travelling reasonably often to the US back then.
US border officers hated UK passports compared to Canadian ones, as they had to do
extra paperwork back then for a visa waiver. Having a Canadian passport meant no need
for a visa to enter the US, even a waiver. A big difference. 

So I apply, and after a long wait, I gain citizenship. There's a ceremony with a judge
and all, and after everything you get the certificate. But oh: mine only has **three** 
names on it, and digging into the policy, "flag names" don't show on citizenship certificates.
Therefore, "flag names" don't show on a Canadian passport. So now I have two passports, one a
UK one with four names, and a Canadian one with three.

Still, none of this is a big deal until my UK passport expires.

Aside, an amusing story: thanks to Brexit, I very nearly ended up stuck in the UK 
because the literal expiry date in my UK passport was wrong. There was an EU policy of
a grace period, which the UK Home Office in its limited wisdom dropped, so literally
the passports expired (as far as the UK was concerned) about six months before the
date printed in the passport. So, forgive me for not trusting UK passport folks. 

Anyways, back to the renewal. You'd think it would be straightforward, but in 2016 the
UK started [a "one name" policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/names-aligning-names-on-foreign-documents/names-aligning-names-on-foreign-documents-accessible): 
when you apply for a passport, even a renewal, you have
to send a complete copy of every page of every other passport you hold. And now, hey presto, 
my UK passport and my Canadian passport show different names. So they won't issue a UK passport
unless I get Canada to change the name in my Canadian passport, which they won't/can't because
it needs to match the citizenship certificate which cannot include a flag name.

So, helpful suggestions from the UK passport folks included: giving up and not being
able to travel to the UK, or legally changing my name in Canada to the name I already
have in Canada. 

In theory, if Canada refuses to let me change the name in my Canadian passport (which they have) that
**in theory** should count as an exception, and unlock the UK one, but no promises. 

What I still don't know is: what the heck is a "flag name" anyways. Although, when I looked
at the confirmation of permanent residence form.
