Everything I hate about Apple Photos

1. It's ludicrously slow and laborious, even when it is actually working
correctly. For example, if you want to delete 15,000 photos? That will lock up
the app for 4-6 hours. If you watch, it's sucking in literally gigabytes of disk
data even for relatively simple things. 

2. It's too deeply integrated into the operating system. Photos uses a bunch of
associated processes to work, outside the application itself, but locked to its
libraries. Among other things, this means that storing your photos on an
external drive may be impossible, because the drive is constantly being used,
and can never be ejected. 

4. It's doing too much in the background. For example, it's nice to detect
duplicates, but this is done by one of the background tasks, not Photos itself.
It doesn't happen on demand. You have to leave your system plugged in for days
or even weeks to get the duplicates detected. 

5. It's trying to be too clever. Duplicate detection, again. It's good to have
it, but it fails to distinguish between *exact* duplicates and *similar images*.
You usually don't want exact duplicates, but when you use photo bursts, you will
end up with a series of pictures with small differences. These are not
duplicates, but Photos just mixes them all together into the same duplicate
detection.

3. The UX sucks. Many of these are relatively straightforward UX issues, which
should never have gone into production. A small amount of testing with real
users would have made a big difference. Like, if you select a few thousand
pictures, even the top menu bar may hang for minutes at a time.

6. "Microsoft syndrome" -- big surface changes for no good reason.

6. The AI, oddly, isn't my gripe. That's not bad, as far as I can tell. I don't
know for sure that it's as privacy-preserving as they say, but it's generally not too intrusive and still useful. Much better than most of the main AI vendors, anyway.
