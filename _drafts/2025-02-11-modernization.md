Somewhat surprisingly, I find myself standing against what the big technology
companies stand for today. This is how it happened.

## Modernization in a nutshell

The modern world is a product of two processes of modernization. First, there is
the process of transforming society from one of tradition to one of industry.
The era of tradition is rooted in craft and skill, and while these are wonderful
and valuable, they are also expensive, slow, and unpredictable. It is,
generally, a good thing to help, for example, farming, to improve yields, and
reduce the risk of bad harvests. That helps prevent some of the consequences,
like famine. We may romantically lament the loss of subsistence agriculture, 
but the reality is, it was pretty awful to have to live in it. So, that kind 
of progress is a Good Thing. 

The second, more recent, process of modernization is when industry itself starts
to get transformed. At this stage, tradition is a thing of the past. Big Food
starts to emerge. Land ownership is also consolidating. There is vertical
integration up and down the supply chain, and across borders, the same company
may control the farms, the processing plants, the bakery, the packaging, and the
store. Technological innovations are part of this, seed strains and genetic
modifications that consolidate control over production.

This same pattern, a first modernity of industrial innovation and global trade,
followed by a newer *second* modernity of the world today with its transnational
corporations, the rise of service industries, and a gradual loss of the remaining
fragments of tradition.  

This pattern repeats itself from sector to sector. In retail, first modernity
brought us catalogue stores like Sears or the Acme Corporation; second modernity
brought us Amazon and eBay. In finance, first modernity brought us banks; second
modernity is bringing us hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital. In
media, first modernity brought us daily newspapers and cable television; second
modernity is bringing us blogging, Netflix, and YouTube. 

There is one additional and important distinction between the first
modernization and the second. Generally, the first modernization was about
wealth, economies of scale, and so on. The second is not. It is, substantially,
about *risk*. For example, if an agricultural technology company patents a seed
strain, it is doing so to reduce some risk, whether it is the risk of pests
eating the crops, or the risk of customers growing seeds without paying for
them, or something else.

For those who study this second modernity, therefore, it is sometimes called a
"risk society". And as Beck puts it: "while in classical industrial society the
'logic' of wealth production dominates the 'logic' of risk production, in the
risk society this relationship is reversed" (Beck, 1992, p12). 

During the early stages of modernization, the first modernization, risk is more
or less incidental, it is not a primary focus. There are risks, but they are not
foreseen. They can still be catastrophic, of course. DDT is a good example, but
there are many others. Notably, according to Beck, risks take centre stage in
the second modernization. 

> "The diffusion and commercialization of risks do not break with the logic of
> capitalist development completely, but instead they raise the latter to a new
> stage. ... Modernization risks from the winners' points of view are *big
> business*." (Beck, 1992, p23, original emphasis). 

It is this injection of risks, and especially known and *manufactured* risks,
that makes this second modernity so important to modern society. 

## Technology in a second nutshell

So far, so good, but we haven't yet talked much about technology. During the
first part of modernization, technology is what helps create the industrial
society. Often, it starts with processes like automation. In agriculture, the
combine harvester is a good example.

But in second modernity, in the risk society, technology has a completely
different role. Genetically-modified crops, for example, may:

* Enable better crop yields, due to resistance to drought and pests
* Enable better nutrition, with modifications to plant nutrient balances
* Enable intellectual property protection, through patenting

Despite these advantages, which are very significant economically, there are
known risks. Crops may be allergenic, they may induce resistance in pests, and
the genetic modifications may flow into natural crops. 






For example, if people start to use a blockchain to
record the provenance of food items (this is not a ridiculous idea, by the way)
that 



Beck's argument is that in this second, reflexive modernity, risks become
far more significant, and in many ways, they are more pressing than 
money. In second modernity, trickle-down economics does work (for a change)
but paradoxically, what trickles down is not money, but risks. 

And there are a lot of risks -- some for the consumers, but far more for 
vendors. Among these risks:

1. The risk of having products de-listed, or down-prioritized in search
   listings.
2. The risk of having products cloned and sold competitively by others, 
   or even by the marketplace owner themselves
3. The risk of having products delivered with inappropriate packaging
4. 

These risks are collectively being downloaded onto vendors and consumers
by the marketplace owner. 

In effect, a vendor has a new boss, Amazon, and has to do what the boss
wants, under an asymmetric agreement. 

* Uber and Lyft have drivers with a quasi-employee status -- the companies
  do not have the normal employment burdens.
* Open AI limits liability to $100, regardless of the impacts their
  technology may have -- it is application vendors who bear the brunt of
  any consequences.
* Open AI, like other AI companies, insists that (a) it should have the right to
  use any copyrighted material for its own commercial gain, and simultaneously
  (b) that using its models' outputs to train other models should be prohibited.
* Amazon? Another marketplace, 
* Qualcomm?
* PayPal has a long record of locking accounts and seizing funds without reason
  or explanation. [Cryptome](https://www.theregister.com/2010/03/10/cryptome_paypal/)
  and 


"The wave of automation sparked by microelectronics produces hybrid forms
between paid and unpaid labor, in which the proportion of labor mediated by the
market is decreasing, but the proportion of unpaid consumer labor is increasing.
The wave of automation in the service sector can thus be understood as a
transfer of labor from production to consumption, from the specialist to the
general public, from compensaÂ­tion to self-participation." (Beck, 1992, p220)

## The strange case of venture capital

The first glimmerings of this second stage of modernization started around 1980,
and are intrinsically linked to venture capital funding.

The explosive growth in the late 1990s

But let's be analytical here, what is venture capital? It is a relatively
high-risk set of investments, with the goal of creating very high return
*companies*. 

Venture capital represented a huge pivot. Up to then, innovation tended to
happen within industrial companies. They might dream up a new machine, one

A perfect example: the early history of computing in industry, the early UK
computer, the LEO, was developed within J. Lyons and Co., a chain of tea shops.
The IBM 650 grew out of their established calculator product range. There was no
venture funding -- these were investments within companies, and often
controversial ones at that. All major companies had large research and
development divisions that assessed opportunities like this.

The controversial side shows the risk. Putting years of effort into something
that might make no difference to the bottom line, that's a scary prospect,
even for a relatively successful company.

Enter venture capital. Essentially, under venture capital funds, the risk of
innovation is aggregated and even downloaded in exactly the same way that Uber
aggregates and downloads the risks of being a paid driver. In a real sense,
early stage founders are gig workers for venture capital firms.

## Beyond capitalism

The point, then, is that what is often called "late-stage capitalism" is not only
about wealth. It is also -- and maybe even more -- about immunity from risks.

* Spotify has [a record of paying for fake
  artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Spotify#Playlist_fiddling_and_partnerships_with_low-royalty_production_companies)
  and injecting their work into playlists to reduce the amount they would
  otherwise pay in royalties.
