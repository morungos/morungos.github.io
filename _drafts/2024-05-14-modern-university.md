To begin with a confession: I was wtong, I freely admit it.

About 20 years ago, I was tasked (or voluntold) with leading a working 
group to assess what the future of my then university might be, over a
fifteen year timescale. Although we expected many small changes, we 
didn't forsee anything major or structural within that timeframe. We did
expect a gradual encroachment of technology, and another gradual 
encroachment of governmental regulation, we missed the big one. We 
missed -- I missed, anyway -- what is perhaps the most significant change
in higher education in the past hundred years or so. As I said, I was wrong.

What is this change? It is the emergence of a truly modern university. 
This modern university is largely a 21st Century creature.

To be fair -- to myself, anyway -- I don't think I was the only one
who missed this. John Seely Brown's "The University in the Digital Age"
has, I believe, also missed the point -- and 

I think, mostly, we were all looking in the wrong place. We were looking for 
a technological change. But this new modern university is not a technological
creation. If anything, it is a political beast, or maybe an economical one. 

So what are the characteristics of this modern university?

+ Traditional universities | Modern universities |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Local, based in a city | Global, multiple campuses |
| A self-managed community of scholars | Managed by a board as a corporation |

To be fair, the erosion of university self-management as a community of scholars is 
nothing new. What used to be a tension between "town and gown" is now more a tension
between "crown and gown" (apologies to republicans, but I am sure you get the idea), 
as central governments increasingly take a bigger role in directing university policies. 
In the UK, this really started to gain momentum in 1992, which unified funding, 
allowed polytechnics to apply for university status, and removed further education
colleges from local control. 

So maybe another reason we missed the emergency of this newly modern university
was that we were already ten years into the process, we just had yet to see 
the full ramifications.

## Teaching and research

This where we really got it badly wrong. We didn't expect a significant change in
the duality of teaching and research within a university. We absolutely should
have seen this coming. 

In practice, the dominance of universities over research is relatively recent,
anyway. Before around 1950s, the lines were much more blurry. A lot of research
was the realm of the independently wealthy, corporations, or other institutions.
