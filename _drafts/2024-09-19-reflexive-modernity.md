Those of you who have stumbled on my occasional social media profiles
may have seen that I bang on a bit about reflexive modernity as an important
lens for thinking about the world we live in today. 

To summarise it, the point goes something like this:

1. Around about the 1990s, a global trade in *risks* started to become more
   significant than the global trade in goods. 

2. Risks behave like a kind of "anti-wealth" -- where wealth tends to accumulate
   at the top, risks tend to accumulate on the shoulders of the less powerful
   and the less wealthy. 

3. Technology enables risks to be processed, moved, and even generated, at
   scale.
