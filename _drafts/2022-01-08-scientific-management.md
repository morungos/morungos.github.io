… If only. But we can hope.

This is a test of shared editing. I wrote this on the iPad, and it will be
interesting to see if it gets shared across devices right.

The defining features of scientific management are hard to pin down, but generally 
it applies a positivist approach to improving economic efficiency. Taylor 
identified five main principles:

	1.	Science, not rule of thumb
	2.	Harmony, not discord
	3.	Mental revolution
	4.	Cooperation, not individualism
	5.	Development of every person to their greatest efficiency and prosperity

Beyond the Anglosphere

Although scientific management grew out of industrial work in the UK and the US, 
it was highly influential elsewhere, notably in the Soviet Union and in Japan. 
Efficiency was just as important an element in a socialist economy as in a 
capitalist one, and Lenin — who had initially been skeptical of American ideas — 
ended up endorsing scientific management and its benefits for “lazy” Russian 
workers.

And in Japan, scientific management again fell on fertile ground, especially after the Second War destroyed substantial parts of the infrastructure.

Scientific management today

Today, perhaps, the foremost company applying scientific management is Google. The 
actual methods used by Google are somewhat different to those of Taylor, but the 
principle is the same: measure relentlessly, with a view to replacing human 
expertise with automation and incentive wherever possible. Cooperation is promoted 
by intentionally creating a social identity — the “Googler” — and working with a 
reasonable degree of openness and transparency internally. 

But scientific management is alive and well in many companies. McDonaldization is 
itself a direct descendant of Taylor’s approach. Similarly, companies like Uber and 
Lyft — indeed all gig-work companies — follow Taylor’s principles closely.
