Is the concept of intellectual property forcing us to apply a *feudal* style of
ownership to ideas? And if so, what does this mean for society and the greater
good?

These questions have been troubling me for a while. In part, that's because the
corporate artificial intelligence community's wholescale appropriation of art,
literature, and code under the guise of "fair use" -- despite their blatant
intention to complete with authors of art, literature, and code -- strains
credibility to the point that ownership of intellectual property may be starting
to break down. 

Rather than diving first into copyright, let's look first at an older form of 
(intellectual) property right -- patents -- because these give the game away to
some extent. And then we can come back to the more familiar copyright issues 
in a moment.

# Patents

First of all, originally, a "letters patent" was an open letter from the
monarch, granting a right or status in writing, for all to see.

For example the Worshipful Company of Stationers, which had monopoly rights over
printing presses in England, was given that right in 1557 through a Royal
Charter, a formal grant written in the form of a letters patent. That was not
unusual for that time, the English monarch tended to sell monopoly rights freely
(in return for "royalties"), to land, to industry -- at least until Parliament
began to limit their power to do so in the [*Statute of
Monopolies*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ja1/21/3/contents). But the
concept is an old one, and common across common law countries -- the US, for
example, uses ["land patents"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_patent) to
pass public land to private individuals and corporations. 

Patents for inventions likely flowed from Venice, where they were first
established: as merchants travelled and traded, they sought to secure markets,
and asking monarchs for a limited monopoly was an excellent way to do that, so
despite the wide variations in legal system, the concept of a patent spread.
After all, buying a monopoly right from a monarch looks like a great deal -- the
trader gets the monopoly and can push up prices, and the King gets the immediate
income. The only loser is a buyer paying inflated prices -- but if the
innovation improves productivity, even they stand to gain. At least, that's the
ideal. 

And although they have evolved somewhat, modern patents for inventions have a
monopoly standing that is recognizably derived from these letters patent. But
there were important changes. First, the *Statute of Monopolies* stopped the
King from granting an indefinite monopoly: it could only last for a fixed number
of years. In effect, over a few hundred years, the patent system slowly changed,
through both common law and statutes, from a system of royal bribes and
back-handers to what it is today: a specific offering of a temporary monopoly in
return for public declaration of an innovation, such that anybody can use it (in
theory) once the monopoly expires.

# Monopolies

But let's look at this deal in more detail. Imagine that you have invented a new
kind of light bulb, and want to sell it. But to do so, you need an investment so
you can begin to produce them. The typical pattern here is to file a patent for
your invention. This costs some money, but it grants you that temporary
monopoly, during which time, lets you stop anyone else making copies of your
technology. This patent, therefore, has a roughly quantifiable financial future
value, because (assuming your product is worth selling) you have that temporary
monopoly on future sales. This patent is valuable enough that you can use it to
ask investors for money -- they will now assess your company as being valuable
because you have this patent. Your company can literally have no other assets,
and still be worth millions because of this patent. 

But this value is a fiction. You haven't yet made or sold a single light bulb. 

If you want to look at a real example of this, consider Tesla. Tesla is assessed
by the stock market as more valuable than Ford and General Motors combined. And
yet, Ford and GM together sell over 5,000,000 vehicles a year, while Tesla has
yet to beat 500,000, and many of those are stuck in parking lots because nobody
wants to buy them. Tesla's value is a fiction sold on an expectation to generate
*future* wealth, not an assessment of current value. 

But it's worse than that. This valuation matters beyond Tesla itself -- it
attracts capital investment from elsewhere in society based on this fiction in a
way that supports Tesla, not other companies that have more realistic
valuations. 

Someone might comment that Tesla has undertaken not to enforce its patents.
However, in practice, [it has done
so](https://electrek.co/2023/07/17/tesla-sues-supercapacitor-company-over-patent-infringement-despite-open-patent-pledge/).
This is because Tesla has a "good faith" clause which means all bets are off if
you sue Tesla. They still own the patents, and can still enforce them. They
appear to have weaponized their patent portfolio into a tool to dissuade anyone
from suing them for anything. It's a "don't poke the bear" strategy,
essentially.

In effect, the purpose of a patent has evolved beyond its original purpose
of incentivising discovery through temporary monopolies for eventual social
good, into a system of more or less permanent 

# Copyright

Copyright has a different history. It was framed in the original [*Statute of
Anne*](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/33333/pg33333-images.html) as a way
to give authors power to protect themselves from monopolistic behaviours by the
printer's guild, the Stationer's Company (yes, the exact same Stationer's
Company that was created as a monopoly to give the monarch and the government a
tool for censorship). This early form of copyright gave authors the right to
control printing -- again, for a limited period -- in explicit acknowledgement
that authors needed to feed their families. But, in practice, the new law still
left the Stationer's Company with monopoly powers. Because the Stationer's
Company continued to control the presses, authors couldn't simply print for
themselves, and even when the monopoly period lapsed, "public domain" didn't
exist in practice because the presses were still monopolized. The new law of
copyright simply meant, at first, that authors were forced to sell copyright
alongside the manuscript. 

Like patents, over time, a new deal emerged that struck a better balance between the
needs of the King and/or government and the needs of authors. There was a
significant international aspect, too: the true shape of modern copyright was
really established much later, by the [Berne Convention](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/).

But in other ways copyright is fundamentally different to patents. Smith, for
example, makes a compelling case that a patent is a *discovery*, not an
*invention*. If you like, the concept of an incandescent light bulb was lying in
wait, in nature (or the laws of physics), simply waiting for someone to find it.
That's arguably even more true for penicillin, for example, or insulin. The
origin of these patentable discoveries in nature strongly argue they should
speedily end up some form of communal pwnership for social good.

Copyright isn't like that. Hamlet wasn't simply lying in wait waiting to be
found, hidden on a back shelf in Borges's[ *Library of
Babel*](https://archive.org/details/TheLibraryOfBabel). Authors and artists
create (*pace* Michelangelo). There is, therefore, a case to be made for a
different model for copyright, or for other author's rights.

The reason for this is that what authors do is not the same. If you need a
relatively efficient way of converting electricity into light, that says nothing
about the person who discovers it. It doesn't reflect the author's personality. 

# Labour and artificial intelligence

A common feature of of copyright, patents, and similar intellectual property, is that
they must result from real labour. Anything that is trivial or automated is not
protected. If you design a logo, or compose a piece of music, using dice or a 
random number generator -- or, indeed, any other algorithm -- it can't be owned at all.

Interestingly, OpenAI attempt to push the envelope of copyright here:

> "**Ownership of content.** As between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted
> by applicable law, you (a) retain your ownership rights in Input and (b) own
> the Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if
> any, in and to Output." ([OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/))

So far, no jurisdiction has allowed an algorithm to create ownable copyrighted
material, but there are a lot of caveats here in the "As between you and
OpenAI", the "to the extent permitted by applicable law", and the "if any".

This makes sense -- despite the enormous environmental impact of OpenAI's 
implementations of their algorithms, they are still just algorithms. There is 
no human labour involved in specific output[^Feedback]. 

[^Feedback]: It is possible that relevance feedback is involved, and the
    ownership of the relevance feedback will be owned by OpenAI. And, of course,
    there is *immense* labour in the training materials. But these create the
    model, the algorithm. That is a very different thing from the output, and
    raises both technical and social issues, worth analyzing in more depth.

Setting aside OpenAI's shenanigans, let's consider the products of 
artificial intelligence as automation. Beck (1992, p220) makes an intriguing point
about what is going on under automation:

> "The wave of automation in the service sector can thus be understood as a
> transfer of labor from production to consumption, from the specialist to the
> general public, from compensa­tion to self-participation." (Beck, 1992, p220)

In other words, if we look at, say, DALL-E, it transfers labour from *artists*
to *consumers*. It is not that there is no work going on, but what work there
is, is smaller, less specialized, and participatory. 

Since now the labour is in *consumption*, not *production*, people who use AI to
generate images might perceive that that they have some kind of a property
ownership over the results of their labour. 

And there's another problem. If an AI is trained on content that *is* the
product of labour, and replicates it *without* labour, we have the conundrum
that while the original is protected, the replica is not -- even if the two are
absolutely identical. 

Borges explored this issue more than once. In *The Library of Babel*, which
imagines an immense library where every single possible book already exists,
before concluding: "The certitude that everything has been written negates us or
turns us into phantoms". And in *Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote*, Borges
suggests that through even greater labour, Pierre Menard was the author of a
greater text of *Don Quixote* than Cervantes had been, even though the two texts
were identical. In both cases, we see that the value of intellectual property
is proportional to the labour of creating it. 

Of course, the labour involved in consumption under automation is trivial --
there's no creativity -- not even much effort -- in choosing which generated
image you like best. And even if you argue that there is creativity and labour
in assembling a prompt, that establishes rights over the prompt, not any
results from using it.

# The naive psychology of ownership

Why is this? Why do people believe that the results of their interactions 
with tools like DALL-E are *theirs* in any meaningful sense, rather than, 
almost as with patents, *discoveries* of the latent potentials in the model?
For that matter, why do we feel that discoveries can be owned at all, 
even with patents? Insulin is a naturally-occurring substance, encoded in
the human genome. Should it be patentable?

There is, interestingly, a case for a naive theory of ownership, much like naive
physics and naive psychology (Nancekivell *et al.*, 2019). This comprises an
understanding of ownership, rights, control over one's possessions, and using
ownership to predict and interpret other people's emotional reactions. As with
others naive theories, this begins to emerge at a young age. 

This also extends to a theory of how ownership can be created. For example,
there is evidence that even very young children (2 or 3 years old) regard things
that they invest effort into making as 'theirs' (Kanngiesser & Hood, 2014). In
other words, we tend to think that stuff we put effort into is 'ours' -- and
this affects how we react to it. 

In other words, lying behind all forms of intellectual property, there is a
"common sense property right", and it is more or less as simple as: "if I put
work into making something, it is a piece of 'property' that is mine by right,
and I can use it as I see fit".

In many ways, this is more explicit in civic law handling of copyright. For
example, the *droit d'auteur* of French law, which was profoundly infuential to
the Berne Convention, includes the concept of *moral rights*, distinct from the
purely economic rights of copyright developed through the English common law
system. These rights come from the author's *natural rights* to benefit from
their labour. These roots in natural law 

# Moral rights

So let's look at moral rights in a little more detail. Moral rights weren't
art of the original English version of copyright, still less patents, because
they're much less like property. And they don't apply to everything -- they don't apply to movies,
for example. 

There are two basic moral rights: the right to be identified (or not) as the
author, and the right to preserve the integrity of the work from changes that
affect the author's reputation.

Generally, moral rights are attached to the author, and they cannot be sold --
although in some cases they are inherited by heirs. In some places they can be
waived -- and it is common for license agreements assigning copyright to include
these waivers

One or the more famous examples was in the Eaton Centre -- a shopping mall in
Toronto, which had an installation of flying geese. The owners of the shopping
centre decided to spruce them up by decorating them for Christmas, but the
artist used their moral rights to object, arguing that the newly Christmassy
geese harmed the integrity of the artwork. 

# A better way

The distinction between patents (which tend to be discoveries) and copyrights
(which tend to be creations) is a useful one -- and one that is easily blurred 
in the soupy mess of modern intellectual property rights.

There is a good case that monopolies should simply no longer apply to patents.

Copyright is different. The personality of the author or creator is important, 
and has to be recognized as such. This means we need to strengthen the role pf
moral rights, not weaken them. We could, for example, easily extend them to online
works. 

However, what has to end is the modern enclosure -- regarding copyrighted materials
as commons simply because they are publicly accessible, and then using that to 
automate in a way that directly harms the ability of authors to earn a decent 
living from their labours -- and, just as importantly -- protect their reputations.
The simplest way for this to happen would be for courts to decide that what the likes
of OpenAI are doing is not "fair use" , which it patently isn't.

If, on the other hand, they do decide that "fair use" can be used in a direct 
assault on the livelihoods and reputations of authors, then copyright as an 
earned right to enjoy the fruits of one's labours is, essentially, dead.
